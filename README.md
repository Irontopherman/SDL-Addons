# SDL-Addons
An SDL based repository for an easier time written in C++ with C implementation.

This repository is a place for a bunch of addons for SDL
where the goal is to make things easier while still giving
the user as much handling on what is happening as possible.

This is one of my first C++ projects, so it most likely 
wont be perfect by any means, just as a warning.
