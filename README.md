# SDL3-Addons
An SDL3 based repository for an easier time written in C++.
Requires SDL3 as a dependency, obviously.
This repository is a place for a bunch of extras for SDL,
where the goal is to make things easier while still giving
the user as much handling on what is happening as possible.

This is also made to help get begginners into coding with
C++ and SDL, to make simple drawing and collision handled
by this so you can focus on getting better and making games.

This is one of my first C++ projects, so it
doesn't work perfectly

currently includes

Actor Class (simple drawing, collision, and other features) C / C++
Image Loader (very efficent drawing, with batched sprite drawing in progress) C
# if you use this in your project, please credit!
