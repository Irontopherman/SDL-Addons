Visual Studio:
To include this in visual studio is very simple.
**you need SDL3 and SDL3_image installed and 
included correctly for this to work; i would 
reccomend running hello.c in SDL before including 
this, just to make sure your installation is correct.**

1. At the top of the visual studio window there will be A
button that says "Project". Click that and from the dropdown
menu select "VC++ Directories"

2. in the window in front of you click on "Configuration Properties"
and in Configuration Properties select "VC++ Directories". In the section
labeled "General", click on "Include Directories". Add your path to the header files 
to the include directories .e.g "C:something/SDL-Addons/Actor/C++/".

3. Finally, go back to the solution explorer and right click on the section
labeled "Header Files", click "Add Existing Item" and select Actor.h and 
Actor.cpp. 

4. to actually use this in your project, at the very beginning where you
include everytihng else, type 
#include "Actor.h"

All images are loaded from the images directory in the current working directory.
If it does not find this directory then it will not crash the program, but it will
flood the console with error messages.

Actors are defined like this:

Image name 
X,
Y,
Angle,
Scale,

Functions: 

    sees if a single triangle collides with another triangle and returen the first collision point as a pointer.    
    bool singletricollide(const SDL_Vertex* tri1, const SDL_Vertex* tri2, SDL_FPoint* intersectionPoint);**IMPLEMENTED IN C**
    

    This function is built to place corners and front center points so that
    other calculations can creat triangles and other various uses. This
    function does have some expensive math, so it is left out for simple
    actors, and only works for normal and complex actors
    void rotatecollide(Actor* target);
    

    this function goes thorugh all pixels in a image
    and if theyhave an alpha channel greater than one
    it adds that value as 1 to a bitmap, else it will
    make it 0. One of the more expensize math functions,
    and cannot be used on simple actors, because the
    function uses some expensize math. Takes about 14
    milliseconds to work, so performance could be better
    void init_good_collide(Actor* target);

    
    draws a persice line using SDL_RenderGeometry
    Does have some displacement issues, but overall
    better for lines than default function.
    void drawline(Actor* target, SDL_Renderer* renderer, SDL_FPoint p1, SDL_FPoint p2, float thickness, SDL_FColor color);

    shows the collision of the goodcollide function
    if called in the specified renderer
    void showcollide(Actor* target, SDL_Renderer* ren);

    simple algebra function to see if
    two lines intersect, used in goodcollide
    to find the area of bitmap overlap checking
    bool lineintersect(Actor* target, const SDL_FPoint* a1, const SDL_FPoint* a2,
        const SDL_FPoint* b1, const SDL_FPoint* b2,
        SDL_FPoint* intersectionPoint);
    

    converts from a screen pixel to the bitmap coordinate that corrosponds to it to it
    void scrn_to_bmp_px(Actor* target, int p_x, int p_y, int* exit_x, int* exit_y);

    returns if a point is insode of a polgon
    bool pointinpolygon(Actor* target, const SDL_FPoint polygon[], const SDL_FPoint p, int64_t polygonsize);

    takes a polygon, step, and a fillarray and fills the array with all points instide the polygon. WARNING: this function\
    can be very dangerous and should never be called in any application made using this code library; DO NOT CALL THIS FUNCTION UNLESS
    YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS DOES IN GREAT DETAIL.   
    void getallpolypoints(Actor* target, const SDL_FPoint polygon[], float step, SDL_FPoint fillarray[], int polysize, int fillarraysize, int* totalamountofpoints);

    takes some points and resturns the convex hull of the points
    int convex_hull(SDL_FPoint* pts, int n, SDL_FPoint** hull_out);

    tests basic collision between two actors; ignores bitmaps but includes angle, direction, and scale.
    bool testbasiccollide(Actor* target, Actor* collider);
    

    this shows what goodcollide does if it is called
    void showcollide(SDL_Renderer* ren)

    finds all points where two actors intersect with a rectangle on
    the outside of the image then loops through all collision points
    and compares them to the bitmap of the actor to see if the
    bitmaps collide, which means it ignores clear pixels. This function
    is very very slow currently, cannot be used with simple actors, will
    throw logic error if you try to use it with one.
    TL;DR: false of they dont collide, true if the opaque parts of the sprites do collide
    bool goodcollide(Actor* target, Actor* collider);
    

    update function for actors will not be drawn but still need math and updates
    void update(Actor* target, SDL_Renderer* renderer);
    

    creates the texture of the actor that will be drawn to the screen if the texture has changed
    void maketextture(Actor* target, SDL_Renderer* renderer);
    

    renders debug information about the sprite
    void renderdebug(Actor* target, SDL_Renderer* renderer);

    resturns if a point intersects with a triangle using simple math
    bool tricollpnt(Actor* target, const SDL_FPoint* p, const SDL_FPoint* a, const SDL_FPoint* b, const SDL_FPoint* c);
    

    quickly and easily draw actor to specified renderer
    automatically creating texture, texture coordnates,
    x and y calculations, and image data.
    TL;DR: draws actor to renderer
    void quickdraw(Actor* target, SDL_Renderer* renderer);
    

    draws all points and simpe collision of the actor
    void drawcollide(Actor* target, SDL_Renderer* renderer, int R, int G, int B, int A);

    
    basic rectangle collision. ignores angle, bitmap, and direction.
    bool rectcollide(Actor* target, SDL_FRect colliderect);
